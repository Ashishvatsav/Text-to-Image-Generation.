Overview

This project focuses on generating realistic images from text descriptions using a Custom Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). Unlike conventional GANs, our approach integrates caption embeddings to condition the image generation process, ensuring that the output images are semantically aligned with the given text.

The project uses the Oxford 102 Flowers Dataset, which contains both flower images and their captions, making it suitable for conditional text-to-image synthesis.

 Objectives
	‚Ä¢	Build a custom DCGAN capable of generating images from textual descriptions.
	‚Ä¢	Modify the baseline DCGAN architecture with advanced techniques for better training stability.
	‚Ä¢	Experiment with different embedding methods and optimizers.
	‚Ä¢	Evaluate performance using both quantitative metrics (FID) and qualitative analysis of generated samples.

 Methodology

1. Dataset
	‚Ä¢	Oxford 102 Flowers dataset.
	‚Ä¢	Each image is associated with multiple captions describing color, shape, and type.
	‚Ä¢	Preprocessing steps:
	‚Ä¢	Images resized to 64√ó64 RGB.
	‚Ä¢	Captions tokenized and embedded using GloVe embeddings (300D).

‚∏ª

2. Text Preprocessing
	‚Ä¢	Tokenization with nltk.
	‚Ä¢	Padding/truncation applied to fixed length.
	‚Ä¢	Word embeddings generated using pre-trained GloVe (300D) vectors.
	‚Ä¢	Caption embeddings averaged into a single fixed-size vector per description.

# Example: text preprocessing
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from gensim.models import KeyedVectors
import numpy as np

glove = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format("glove.6B.300d.txt", binary=False)

def get_caption_embedding(caption):
    tokens = word_tokenize(caption.lower())
    embeddings = [glove[word] for word in tokens if word in glove]
    return np.mean(embeddings, axis=0)

3. Model Architecture

Generator
	‚Ä¢	Input: Random noise (z=128) + caption embedding.
	‚Ä¢	Concatenated and passed through dense + reshaping layers.
	‚Ä¢	Upsampling using ConvTranspose2D layers.
	‚Ä¢	GELU activation + BatchNorm for smoother gradients.
	‚Ä¢	Output: 64√ó64√ó3 synthetic image.

Discriminator
	‚Ä¢	Input: Real/Fake image + caption embedding (projected).
	‚Ä¢	Caption embedding spatially replicated and concatenated with image.
	‚Ä¢	Multiple Conv2D layers with LeakyReLU + Spectral Normalization.
	‚Ä¢	Output: probability of image being real or fake.

‚∏ª

4. Training Strategy
	‚Ä¢	Optimizer: RMSprop (lr=0.0002, Œ≤1=0.5).
	‚Ä¢	Label smoothing to reduce discriminator overconfidence.
	‚Ä¢	Data augmentation on training images (random flips, crops).
	‚Ä¢	Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna for:
	‚Ä¢	Learning rate
	‚Ä¢	Latent dimension
	‚Ä¢	Embedding fusion strategy

2. Generated Samples
	‚Ä¢	Example: Input caption ‚Üí ‚Äúa purple flower with five petals‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Output: Image shows correct color and structure alignment.

# Generate image for a caption
caption = "a purple flower with five petals"
embedding = get_caption_embedding(caption)
noise = torch.randn(1, 128).to(device)
gen_input = torch.cat((noise, torch.tensor(embedding).unsqueeze(0).to(device)), dim=1)
fake_img = generator(gen_input)

3. Evaluation
	‚Ä¢	FID Score: ~45.2 (lower is better; baseline DCGAN ~60+).
	‚Ä¢	Qualitative analysis:
	‚Ä¢	Captions aligned well with generated features.
	‚Ä¢	More stable convergence compared to vanilla DCGAN.
	‚Ä¢	Diversity of samples increased due to spectral normalization + GELU.
